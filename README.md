# Wine-Quality-Prediction
In this project, a Machine Learning model has been created for the prediction of quality of wine with quality ranging between 1 and 10.
The dataset used for in the project contains 12 columns: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol and quality. 
Two ML algorithms, i.e., Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier, have been used for predicting the quality of wine and their performance has also been compared.
